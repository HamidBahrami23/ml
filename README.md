# Daily Machine Learning / Deep Learning Practice

This repository contains my daily ML/DL practice projects.  
Every folder contains an independent Jupyter Notebook focused on a single concept or algorithm.

## Note

**Important:** All the codes in this repository were written by me. I used AI assistance only for:
- Writing and improving the README file
- Adding comments to my codes
- Getting suggestions for better code structures and ideas

The skeleton, logic, implementation, and main codes are entirely my own work.
